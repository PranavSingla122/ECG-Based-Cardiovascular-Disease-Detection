# ECG-Based-Cardiovascular-Disease-Detection

Overview
This project focuses on classifying ECG images into four categories using a fine-tuned ResNet50 deep learning model. The dataset consists of 928 ECG images categorized into:
âœ… Myocardial Infarction (MI) Patients
âœ… Patients with a History of MI
âœ… Patients with Abnormal Heartbeats
âœ… Normal ECGs

Performance Summary
The model achieved 99% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating high precision and recall across all categories.

Class	Precision	Recall	F1-score	Support
Myocardial Infarction Patients	1.00	1.00	1.00	44
History of MI Patients	0.96	0.96	0.96	26
Abnormal Heartbeat Patients	0.98	1.00	0.99	45
Normal ECGs	1.00	0.96	0.98	25

ðŸ”¹ Final Test Accuracy: 98.57%
ðŸ”¹ Best Validation Accuracy: 94.96%
ðŸ”¹ Best Validation Loss: 0.1116
